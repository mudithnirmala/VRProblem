Vehicle Routing Problem. Research Project

Travelling Salesman Problem is a famous optimization problem which can be optimized using genetic algorithm. 
But this problem is not applied for Electric Vehicles considering the Range it can drive in a single charge and the charging time.

In this project customer orders of one outlet(KEELS Rajagiriya 2) of a supermarket chain in Sri Lanka is analysed. The objective is to compare the costs of using both Electric Vehicles and Oil Combusion Vehicles.
For this comparison genetic algorithm is used. Certain modifications are made to original algorithm to help this comparison.
